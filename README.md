# 📚 Java Practice Programs based on Array and String for College Campus Placements 🚀

Welcome to my repository of **Java Programs** based on **Arrays** and **Strings**, designed for regular practice and preparation for college campus placement drives. These include fundamental coding exercises frequently asked in interviews and written rounds.

---

## 📌 About This Repository

This collection contains beginner-friendly Java programs that deal with:

- Number operations
- String manipulations
- Counting characters, digits, vowels/consonants
- Palindrome checks
- Arrays operations *(coming soon!)*

Each program is named sequentially for easy reference and organized by concept.
